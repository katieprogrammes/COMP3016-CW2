# COMP3016-Coursework 2 - Crystal Quest

## Overview
Crystal Quest is a calm, exploration-focused OpenGL game set on a procedurally generated rocky terrain beneath a night sky. The terrain is scattered with crystals, some of which are “real” while others are decoys. The player carries a torch, which they must use to distinguish genuine crystals from fake ones through dynamic lighting and visual effects.

At the start of the game, the player receives a quest list containing specific crystal types they must locate. To progress, they explore the terrain, use the torch to identify real crystals and click on those that match their quest list. Each correct discovery triggers positive audio feedback which reinforces the relaxed and rewarding atmosphere.

The game is designed to feel peaceful and atmospheric, using low-intensity lighting, gentle background music and rewarding audio cues to create to calming mood. The player wins the game by finding all the crystals on their quest list, completing the experience at their own pace.

## Dependencies

The dependencies used were:
- GLAD (OpenGL 4.6 Core Loader) 
- GLFW Version 3.3
- ASSIMP Version 5 to import and handle models and meshes
- IrrKlang Version 1.6 to handle background music and sound effects
- stb_easy_font for lightweight text rendering within the UI
- stb_image for loading texture files used on models and terrain

## Use of AI Description

These were the Assisted Work Sections that my AI usage fell under:

- A7 - I had been following Learn OpenGL to get to grips with OpenGL but once the tutorials strayed away from what I was trying to achieve, I used AI to teach me how the tutorials would be relevant to me and my project.
- A8 - When encountering errors, which Visual Studio was not displaying in user-friendly ways, I used AI to reformat the error message to one I could understand, so that I could then fix my code.
